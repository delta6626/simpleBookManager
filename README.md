# Simple Book Manager

Developed as part of an academic assignment.

This project involves building a simple web application that manages a list of books using JSON for data handling. The application includes a straightforward interface for displaying and modifying book details.

---

**Create a basic web application to manage a book list using JSON.** The app should have a user-friendly interface that displays and allows editing of book details.

**JSON Structure:** Begin by defining a JSON object that represents a collection of books. Each book should include properties like title, author, publication year, and genre. Provide at least three example books in this dataset.

**Displaying the Data:** Write a JavaScript function that reads the JSON data and dynamically generates an HTML table to show the list of books. The table should include columns for Title, Author, Year, and Genre. Demonstrate how the JSON data is parsed and inserted into the table using JavaScript.

**Updating Book Details:** Add functionality that lets users update book information. This should include an input form where users can enter the new title, author, year, and genre of the book they want to edit. Once submitted, the JSON object and the HTML table should both reflect the updated data.

**Removing a Book:** Include a feature that allows users to delete a book from the list by entering its title. After removal, the book should be deleted from both the JSON object and the table.

**Validation:** Implement basic input validation to ensure all fields are filled in and the year is a valid number. Explain how the app handles errors—such as missing fields or invalid input—and how users are prompted to correct these before any updates or deletions are processed.

**Include:**

- An example of the JSON structure used.
- Code snippets showing how data is displayed, updated, and removed using JavaScript.
- A brief explanation of how JSON helps simplify data management in this kind of application.
- Any difficulties or edge cases encountered during the development process.
